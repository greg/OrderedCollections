# OrderedCollections

Ordered set and dictionary implementations for Swift backed by a red-black tree.

**This is still a work in progress**

## Using `RedBlackTree` directly

```swift
import RedBlackTree
```

The `RedBlackTree` type is a struct that implements the `RandomAccessCollection` protocol and some more useful functions, and can be used on its own.
